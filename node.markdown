Most of the services in Remote Lab are using Node. Download [Node.js v14](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 not supported yet) and install. After installation verify that it was installed successfully
```
node --version
```
Also verify that NPM (Node Package Manager) was also installed with Node. NPM is used to download additional packages and dependencies for Node.
```
npm --version
```
