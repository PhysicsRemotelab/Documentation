This technical documentation is meant to guide how to setup Remote Lab software locally and start developing new features. Source code for all Remote Lab projects can be found on [https://github.com/PhysicsRemotelab](https://github.com/PhysicsRemotelab) (requires access to see private repositories).

There are three sections on the site:
- [Dependencies](/documentation/dependencies) - contains list of tools necessary to start development.
- [Local Setup](/documentation/local-development) - guides how to download and setup Remote Lab software locally.
- [Labs](/documentation/labs) - describes labs developed and ready to be used.
